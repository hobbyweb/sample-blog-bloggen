Over the last years, I took some much needed steps towards more data privacy. I started out by moving e-mail and calendar away from Google towards Fastmail, which I'm still very happy with.

Other steps included deleting most of my unhealthy social media presence (Twitter) and switching from Whatsapp to Signal and Telegram. This process took me quite a long time, which is mostly because of the strong network effects created by the big platforms.

I made a lot of progress, gradually moving away from cloud-based tools and especially from services operated by Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple. However, one last and big problem remained - my Android phone.


TODO: journey from google services/gmail/amazon/twitter etc. to no social networks, linux, fastmail
TODO: last bastion -> smart phone, apple not much better and worse in many other regards
TODO: e-os, non profit, privacy based, deGooglify

## Conclusion
